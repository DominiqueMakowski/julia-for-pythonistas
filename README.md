# julia-for-pythonistas
Materials for the Julia for Pythonistas tutorial at Pydata Carolinas 2016

# Setup:
- If you're planning to follow along, please go to [julialang.org](http://julialang.org/downloads/) and download the current stable release. This should be `v0.4.6`. Something slightly older (`>v0.4`) is probably fine.

- Much of the tutorial is in notebooks, but for the tutorial, we'll mostly be using the REPL. When we starting typing larger chunks of code, we'll switch over to using a text editor. You do not need to have Jupyter or IJulia installed.
